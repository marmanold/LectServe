<h2>Welcome to LectServe &alpha;lpha!</h2>
<p>LectServe is a tool I'm providing to the Church to quickly find lectionary readings for a given day.</p>
<p>For an example of how to use the API to automatically pull down the readings each week into a program like <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts 5</a> for weekly sermon prep, please view this <a href="https://www.marmanold.com/tech/drafts-5-sermon-prep-with-lectserve/">guide on my blog</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Date::Lectionary">backend</a> supports both the Revised Common Lectionary and the ACNA lectionary for Sundays and Red-Letter days.  I'm defaulting to the ACNA lectionary because I'm Anglican, but you can use the RCL if you would like.</p>
<p>The daily lectionary <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Date::Lectionary::Daily">backend</a> currently only supports the ACNA lectionary, but more are planned.</p>
<h3>API Usage</h3>
<p>All endpoints return JSON.  Optionally, the argument <tt>?lect=acna</tt> or <tt>?lect=rcl</tt> can be given to each endpoint to specify the lectionary you wish to use for Sundays and Red-Letter days.  <tt>/today</tt> and <tt>/date</tt> can take the argument <tt>dailyLect=?</tt> with the values <tt>acna-sec</tt> or <tt>acna-xian</tt> respectively for the current ACNA daily lectionary based on the civil calendar or the previous daily lectionary based on the liturgical calendar.  The default lectionaries are the ACNA Sunday and Daily (Civil-based).</p>
<dl>
    <dt><a href="/today">/today</a></dt>
    <dd>Returns the lectionary payload for today's date.  "Today" is relative to the server LectServe is running on.  Presently, the server is sitting in Virginia, but I'm not sure if it's running on EST or GMT.</dd>
    <dt><a href="/sunday">/sunday</a></dt>
    <dd>Returns the Sunday-only lectionary payload for the upcoming Sunday relative to "today".</dd>
    <dt><a href="/date/2016-12-25">/date/yyyy-mm-dd</a></dt>
    <dd>Returns the lectionary payload for the given date.  Date is given in four-digit year [yyyy], two-digit month [mm], and two digit day [dd] annotation with dashes between units.  Christmas Day in 2016 would be given as <tt>/date/2016-12-25</tt>, for example.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Technical Information</h3>
<p>LectServe is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance and driven by Perl.  The engine driving this site and the API is the wonderful <a href="http://perldancer.org/">Dancer2</a> framework and the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Starman/script/starman">Starman</a> high-performance web server.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes all the hard work of finding our place in the lectionary is handled by the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Date::Lectionary">Date::Lectionary</a> &amp; <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Date::Lectionary::Daily">Date::Lectionary::Daily</a> modules and three helper modules <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Date::Advent">Date::Advent</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Date::Easter">Date::Easter</a>, and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Date::Lectionary::Time">Date::Lectionary::Time</a>.</p>
